# 2025

Today’s the last day of 2025, and I just wanna say what this year gave me.
Not cringe. Just real.

This year, I **leveled up hard** 🚀
I got solid at **Python, C, and Assembly**,
picked up real experience in **Fortran, Java, and C++**,
and kept learning things I never thought I’d touch this early.

My mindset changed too.
I’m still young (14M), but I decided early that I want to be a **developer** —
so instead of waiting, I started building 💻

This year I shipped a lot:

- **Clawpy**
- **Trappist**
- **FTL**
- **Cryo**
- **BioC**

…and honestly, countless other experiments and late-night ideas 😴

## Thank you guys!!

To everyone who **cloned**, **watched**, or even just _checked out_ my projects —
**THANK YOU SO MUCH.** Like fr.

There was a point where I was close to giving up on this dream.
But when I launched **Cryo** and **BioC**, just _hoping_ someone would care…
and then I saw the **clones** and **views** going up —
that motivation hit DIFFERENT ⚡

That’s why I decided to release **something new every single day in December**.
Not for hype.
Not for numbers.
But because building is what I love 🛠️❤️

2025 taught me one thing:
**Start early. Build loud. Don’t quit.**

2026… we go crazier 🚀
